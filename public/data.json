    "long": "I am a Machine Learning and Geospatial Researcher interested in building intelligent systems that connect simulation, computer vision, and large language models. My work focuses on how AI can learn from structured environmental data and simulated worlds to improve decision-making and perception in complex, real-world systems. My research journey began during my MSc in Environmental Science (Data Science Specialization) at Thompson Rivers University, where I developed metaheuristic and spiral-based optimization algorithms for wildfire prediction across Canadian provinces. Currently, I am exploring how simulation-driven learning, vision-based perception, and language-guided reasoning can converge to create adaptive and interpretable AI systems."
